Hi there <span role="img" alt="waving hand emoji">ðŸ‘‹</span> â€” My name is Joe. I'm a software engineer building cool things on the web. I'm creating this engineering blog as a place to share the things I find interesting, learn, and build.

```ts
type Emoji = string

function buildBlog(): Emoji {
  if (isAfter("2023-08-06")) {
    return "ðŸš€"
  }
  return "ðŸš§"
}
```

Why is it that creatives and engineers are alway starting new projects? I think that maybe it's because we like the chase. It's always fun learning something new.

For this iteration of my "blog", I decided to use static Markdown files (more specifically, MDX) and Next. I had previously been using `contentlayer` to source my local files, but I wanted to try something new - or rather something old. Instead, I'm just using good ol' `fs` to read the files and `gray-matter` to parse the frontmatter. I'm also using `next-mdx-remote` to render the content.

It's a relatively simple setup that I hope I won't have to change too often.

For now, let's see how long I can keep this version running. ‚úåÔ∏è
